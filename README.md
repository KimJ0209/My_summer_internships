# what I built
["My Summer Internships map" app](https://kimj0209.github.io/My_first_Map/) is an app that shows what summer internships I've done and other stops that are affiliated with the internships mentioned. This would show people the opprunities is people are interested on joining these internships.

_Showing what the map does._

# technology
I used...
1. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) library, for styling and displaying maps and route lines, and adding camera behaviors (flyto animations).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to make a README, make sure map works, with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extensions.
3. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), for publishing the app for free!

This code is used to show the image wanted on the website. I found this interesting because of how simple it actally is compared to how complex it looks. I had problems with getting the image to show up, even when it looked simple. I learned other ways to put images on the website and how easy it was.
